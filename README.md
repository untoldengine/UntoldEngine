## About

> "A Swift-based 3D game engine designed for simplicity and creativity on macOS and iOS."

The Untold Engine is an open-source 3D game engine under active development, designed for macOS and iOS platforms. Written in Swift and powered by Metal, its goal is to simplify game creation with a clean, intuitive API. While the engine already supports many core systems like rendering, physics, and animation, there‚Äôs still much to build and improve.

### Current Features:

- Simple API: Focused on ease of use, even for those new to game development.
- Core Systems: Includes foundational systems for entity registration, rendering, physics, and more.
- Metal Integration: Leverages Apple‚Äôs graphics API for efficient rendering.

### The Journey Ahead:

The Untold Engine is a work in progress, with ambitious goals to:

- Expand physics capabilities with collision detection.
- Enhance PBR rendering for more realistic visuals.
- Add new features to make game development a breeze.

### Why Try the Untold Engine?

- For Learners: A great way to explore game development with an engine that prioritizes simplicity.
- For Game Developers: An opportunity to contribute to an open-source project and shape its future.
- For Apple Developers: A Swift and Metal-based engine that feels at home on macOS and iOS.

The engine is far from complete, but with every iteration, it gets closer to being an amazing tool for developers. By trying it out, contributing, or sharing your feedback, you can help make the Untold Engine better for everyone.

## Getting Started

The Untold Engine is a game engine designed to be integrated into your game projects. It is distributed as a Swift Package using Swift Package Manager (SPM) for easy integration and maintenance.

There are two primary ways to use the engine:

- **Running the Engine Standalone** ‚Äì Ideal for contributors and developers who want to explore, modify, or contribute to the engine itself. This mode allows you to test the engine independently using its built-in demo assets and functionalities.
- **Integrating the Engine into Your Game Project** ‚Äì Perfect for game developers who want to build a game using the engine. This requires adding the engine as a Swift Package Dependency in a game project.

### Prerequisites

To begin using the Untold Engine, you‚Äôll need:

- An Apple computer.
- The latest version of Xcode, which you can download from the App Store.

### Installation
Follow the step-by-step guide to [clone and install the Untold Engine](docs/Installation.md)

### Assets Download 
To help you get started, download the [Demo Game Assets v1.0](https://github.com/untoldengine/UntoldEngine-Assets/releases/tag/v1). It contains models and animations that you can use as you try out the engine. Unzip the folder and place it on your Desktop.

### Demo Game - Jump right in
Want to see the Untold Engine in action with zero setup? The **Demo Game** is for you! It‚Äôs a simple, ready-to-run soccer dribbling game ‚Äî perfect for testing the engine and getting a feel for how it works. Follow the step-by-step guide to run the [small demo](docs/demogamesteps.md)

### Starter Game - Experiment and Learn
If you want to tinker and get hands-on, the **Starter Game** is your playground. It‚Äôs a minimal setup that gives you just enough to start experimenting, importing assets, and building your own mechanics. Follow the step-by-step guide to run the [starter game](docs/startergamesteps.md)

For an overview of how to reference entities, play animations, and create components and systems, check out the files in the DemoGame folder. More documentation is on the way, but these examples should be enough to help you get started.
If you run into any issues or have questions, please don‚Äôt hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/untoldengine/UntoldEngine/issues).

### Editor & Workflow

The Editor is now the primary way to initialize and manage entities.  

- [Editor Overview](docs/editoroverview.md): Walkthrough of Scene Graph, Inspector, Gizmos, Materials, Lighting, Post-Processing, Asset Browser, and Console.  
- [How to Import Assets](docs/importingassetseditor.md): Learn how to set asset paths and import models, materials, and animations.  
- [Adding a model using the Editor](docs/addModelUsingEditor.md): Learn how to add a model using the editor 
- [Adding an animation using the Editor](docs/addAnimationUsingEditor.md): Learn how to link an animation to the model using the editor (Coming Soon)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Entities should be created and configured in the Editor. Code is used for gameplay logic only.

## High-Level API Overview

The Untold Engine offers an intuitive API for game development. Here's a quick look:

```swift
let stadium = createEntity()
setEntityMesh(entityId: stadium, filename: "stadium", withExtension: "usdc")
translateBy(entityId: stadium, position: simd_float3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0))

let player = createEntity()
setEntityMesh(entityId: player, filename: "redplayer", withExtension: "usdc", flip: false)
setEntityAnimations(entityId: player, filename: "running", withExtension: "usdc", name: "running")
changeAnimation(entityId: player, name: "running") // Start animation
setEntityKinetics(entityId: player) // Enable Physics System
```
