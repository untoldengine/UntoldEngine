# Common Issues

### ShaderType.h not found

Xcode may fail stating that it can't find a ShaderType.h file. If that is the case, simply go to your build settings, search for "bridging". Head over to 'Objective-C Bridging Header' and make sure to remove the path as shown in the image below

### Linker issues

Xcode may fail stating linker issues. If that is so, make sure to add the "Untold Engine" framework to **Link Binary With Libraries** under the **Build Phases** section.
