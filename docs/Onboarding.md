### Preloaded Goodies to Get You Going

To make life easier, the Untold Engine comes packed with preloaded assets you can use right away:

- Models: A soccer stadium, player, ball, and more.
- Animations: Prebuilt running, idle, and other animations.

You’ll find these in the Resources folder of the engine under Models and Animations. No need to hunt for assets—just focus on learning and having fun!

Example:
Want to load the stadium model into your game? It’s as simple as:


```swift
setEntityMesh(entityId: stadium, filename: "soccerStadium", withExtension: "usdc")
```
