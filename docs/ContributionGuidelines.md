# Contributing Guidelines

I'm excited to have you contribute to the Untold Engine! To maintain consistency and quality, please follow these guidelines when submitting a pull request (PR). Submissions that do not adhere to these guidelines will not be approved.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature or bug fix per PR**  
  Each Pull Request should focus on a single feature, bug fix, or documentation improvement.  
  This keeps the history clean and makes it easier to track down issues later.  

- **Commit hygiene**  
  - Keep commits meaningful (avoid "misc changes" or "fix stuff").  
  - Squash commits if needed, but do not mix unrelated features in the same commit.  
  - If your PR touches multiple files, make sure they all relate to the same feature or fix.  

✅ Example:  
- Good: *“Add PhysicsSystem with gravity integration”*  
- Bad: *“Added PhysicsSystem + fixed rendering bug + updated docs”*
