# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 
 
The vision for Untold Engine is to continually shape a 3D engine that is **stable, performant and developer-friendly**.
As maintainer, my focus is on **performance, testing, quality control, and API design**.  
Contributors are encouraged to expand features, fix bugs, improve documentation, and enhance usability ‚Äî always keeping the vision in mind.

## Maintainer Responsibilities  

The Untold Engine is guided by a clear vision: To be a stable, performant, and developer-friendly 3D engine that empowers creativity, removes friction, and makes game development feel effortless.

## Guiding Principles

To achieve this vision, we follow these principles:

- The engine strives to remain stable and crash-free.
- The codebase is backed by unit tests.
- We profile continuously to prevent regressions (visual and performance).
- The API must remain clear and user-friendly.
- We always think about the developer first‚Äîremoving friction so they can focus on their games.

As the maintainer, my primary focus is to ensure the project stays true to this vision.  

### What I Focus On  
- **Performance** ‚Üí keeping the renderer and systems lean, efficient, and optimized for Apple hardware.  
- **Testing & Stability** ‚Üí maintaining a reliable codebase with proper testing practices.  
- **Quality Control** ‚Üí reviewing PRs for clarity, readability, and adherence to coding standards.  
- **API Design** ‚Üí ensuring that the engine‚Äôs API remains logical, intuitive, and consistent.  

### What Contributors Are Encouraged to Focus On  
- **Features** ‚Üí adding or improving systems, tools, and workflows.  
- **Bug Fixes** ‚Üí addressing open issues and fixing edge cases.  
- **Documentation** ‚Üí clarifying how things work and providing examples.  
- **Editor & Usability** ‚Üí enhancing the UI, workflows, and overall developer experience.  

### Decision Making  
All contributions are welcome, but acceptance will be guided by the project‚Äôs vision and the priorities above.  
PRs that align with clarity, performance, or creativity ‚Äî while keeping the engine stable and simple ‚Äî are more likely to be accepted.   

These guidelines aren‚Äôt here to block you, but to make sure every contribution keeps the engine stable, clear, and useful for everyone.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature or bug fix per PR**  
  Each Pull Request should focus on a single feature, bug fix, or documentation improvement.  
  This keeps the history clean and makes it easier to track down issues later.  

- **Commit hygiene**  
  - Keep commits meaningful (avoid "misc changes" or "fix stuff").  
  - Squash commits if needed, but do not mix unrelated features in the same commit.  
  - If your PR touches multiple files, make sure they all relate to the same feature or fix.  

‚úÖ Example:  
- Good: *‚ÄúAdd PhysicsSystem with gravity integration‚Äù*  
- Bad: *‚ÄúAdded PhysicsSystem + fixed rendering bug + updated docs‚Äù*

## Required Contributions for New System Support

For **new systems or major features**, your PR must include:

- **Unit Tests** ‚Üí Validate functionality and cover edge cases.  
- **How-To Guide** ‚Üí A step-by-step markdown guide explaining how to use the system.  

This ensures new features are stable, documented, and accessible to all users.  

üëâ Note: For small fixes or incremental features, a How-To is not required.

---

### How-To Guide Format

Your guide must follow this structure:

1. Introduction

- Briefly explain the feature and its purpose.
- Describe what problem it solves or what value it adds.

2. Why Use It

- Provide real-world examples or scenarios where the feature is useful.
- Explain the benefits of using the feature in these contexts.

3. Step-by-Step Implementation

- Break down the setup process into clear, actionable steps.
- Include well-commented code snippets for each step.

4. What Happens Behind the Scenes

- Provide technical insights into how the system works internally (if relevant).
- Explain any significant impacts on performance or functionality.

5. Tips and Best Practices

- Share advice for effective usage.
- Highlight common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

6. Running the Feature

- Explain how to test or interact with the feature after setup.
