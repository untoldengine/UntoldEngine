> "A Swift-based 3D game engine designed for simplicity and creativity on macOS and iOS."

The Untold Engine is an open-source 3D game engine under active development, designed for macOS and iOS platforms. Written in Swift and powered by Metal, its goal is to simplify game creation with a clean, intuitive API. While the engine already supports many core systems like rendering, physics, and animation, there’s still much to build and improve.


## Vision

The Untold Engine strives to be a **stable, performant, and developer-friendly** 3D engine that empowers creativity, removes friction, and makes game development feel effortless for Apple developers

## Guiding Principles

To achieve this vision, we follow these principles:

- The engine strives to remain stable and crash-free.
- The codebase is backed by unit tests.
- We profile continuously to prevent regressions (visual and performance).
- The API must remain clear and user-friendly.
- We always think about the developer first—removing friction so they can focus on their games.


### Current Features:

- Simple API: Focused on ease of use, even for those new to game development.
- Core Systems: Includes foundational systems for entity registration, rendering, physics, and more.
- Metal Integration: Leverages Apple’s graphics API for efficient rendering.

### The Journey Ahead:

The Untold Engine is a work in progress, with ambitious goals to:

- Expand physics capabilities with collision detection.
- Enhance PBR rendering for more realistic visuals.
- Add new features to make game development a breeze.

### Why Try the Untold Engine?

- For Learners: A great way to explore game development with an engine that prioritizes simplicity.
- For Game Developers: An opportunity to contribute to an open-source project and shape its future.
- For Apple Developers: A Swift and Metal-based engine that feels at home on macOS and iOS.

The engine is far from complete, but with every iteration, it gets closer to being an amazing tool for developers. By trying it out, contributing, or sharing your feedback, you can help make the Untold Engine better for everyone.
